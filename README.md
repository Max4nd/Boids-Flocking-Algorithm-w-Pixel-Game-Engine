# Boids-Flocking-Algorithm-w-Pixel-Game-Engine
A basic implementation of a Boid Flocking Simulation, made with the OLC Pixel Game Engine.

Performance is good (~650fps) on a i5-3570k, using a single core that is. 
Run in release mode to take advantage of that SIMD goodness.

The physics are slighlty off. Oh well

I can think of a lot of optimizations for this project, namely the quad tree algorithm and multithreading, but I have no plans to implement them.
